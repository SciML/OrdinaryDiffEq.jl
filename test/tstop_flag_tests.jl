# Test for tstop flag functionality
# This tests the new next_step_tstop flag mechanism

using Test

@testset "Tstop Flag Tests" begin
    # Basic test to ensure the flag mechanism doesn't break compilation
    @test true  # Placeholder test
    
    # TODO: Add comprehensive tests once the package compiles
    # These tests would verify:
    # 1. next_step_tstop flag is set correctly when dt is reduced for tstops
    # 2. handle_tstop_step! is called when flag is true
    # 3. Exact tstop snapping works correctly
    # 4. StaticArrays no longer trigger tstop overshoot errors
    # 5. Continuous callbacks still work properly
    # 6. Backward time integration works
    # 7. Multiple close tstops are handled correctly
