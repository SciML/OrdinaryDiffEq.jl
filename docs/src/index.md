# OrdinaryDiffEq.jl

OrdinaryDiffEq.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem.
It holds the core ordinary differential equation solvers and utilities. While completely independent and usable on its own, users interested in using this
functionality should check out
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl).

## Installation

Assuming that you already have Julia correctly installed, it suffices to import
OrdinaryDiffEq.jl in the standard way:

```julia
import Pkg;
Pkg.add("OrdinaryDiffEq");
```
