# OrdinaryDiffEq.jl

OrdinaryDiffEq.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It holds the
ordinary differential equation solvers and utilities. While completely independent
and usable on its own, users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl).

## Installation

Assuming that you already have Julia correctly installed, it suffices to import
OrdinaryDiffEq.jl in the standard way:

```julia
import Pkg;
Pkg.add("OrdinaryDiffEq");
```
