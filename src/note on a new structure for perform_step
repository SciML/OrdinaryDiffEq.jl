Here is few notes about having a new structure of the code concerning the step perform_step! :

News parameters to integrator:
-   u_propose
-   u_changed        
-   dt_has_changed 
-   dt_changed  
-   u_has_changed

New DEOptions
- modif : a callable object to custom computation right after perform_step
--> a beter name could be "modif_step"

Possible function to implement
- change_u, change_dt  DONE
- dt_interval should be implemented

Note :
- Prefer "modified" as kee word instead of "changed"
- maybe should create a cache for modify function to have best performance
--> in that way it could be possible to run once the user modification to get basic element of the cas as u_changed, instead of storing it directly
