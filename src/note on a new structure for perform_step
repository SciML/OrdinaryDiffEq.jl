Here is few notes about having a new structure of the code concerning the step perform_step! :

News parameters to integrator:
-   u_propose
-   u_changed        
-   dt_has_changed -> just a bool
-   dt_changed     -> 
-   u_has_changed  (not implemented yet) -> just a bool

New DEOptions
- modif : a callable object to custom computation right after perform_step

Possible function to implement
- modify_dt(integrator, dt)  --> set dt_has_changed to true by the same occasion
- dt_has_changed(integrator) -> to set true for dt_has_changed  
- u_has_changed(integrator)  -> to set true for u_has_changed
- 

Note :
- Prefer "modified" as kee word instead of "changed"
- maybe should create a cache for modify function to have best performance
--> in that way it could be possible to run once the user modification to get basic element of the cas as u_changed, instead of storing it directly
