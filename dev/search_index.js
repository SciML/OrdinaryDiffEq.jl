Defaults to Val{0}()   and thus uses the internal ForwardDiff.jl algorithm for the choice.\nautodiff: Specifies whether to use automatic differentiation via   ForwardDiff.jl or finite   differencing via FiniteDiff.jl.

Defaults to   nothing, which means it will be chosen true/false depending on circumstances   of the solver, such as whether a Krylov subspace method is used for linsolve.\ndiff_type: The type of differentiation used in FiniteDiff.jl if autodiff=false.   Defaults to Val{:forward}, with alternatives of Val{:central} and   Val{:complex}.\nlinsolve: Any LinearSolve.jl compatible linear solver. For example, to use KLU.jl, specify PDIRK44(linsolve = KLUFactorization()).  When nothing is passed, uses DefaultLinearSolver.\nprecs: Any LinearSolve.jl-compatible preconditioner can be used as a left or right preconditioner. Preconditioners are specified by the Pl,Pr = precs(W,du,u,p,t,newW,Plprev,Prprev,solverdata) function where the arguments are defined as:\nW: the current Jacobian of the nonlinear system. Specified as either   I - gamma J or Igamma - J depending on the algorithm. This will   commonly be a WOperator type defined by OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. It is a lazy   representation of the operator. Users can construct the W-matrix on demand   by calling convert(AbstractMatrix,W) to receive an AbstractMatrix matching   the jac_prototype.\ndu: the current ODE derivative\nu: the current ODE state\np: the ODE parameters\nt: the current ODE time\nnewW: a Bool which specifies whether the W matrix has been updated since   the last call to precs. It is recommended that this is checked to only   update the preconditioner when newW == true.\nPlprev: the previous Pl.\nPrprev: the previous Pr.\nsolverdata: Optional extra data the solvers can give to the precs function.   Solver-dependent and subject to change.\nThe return is a tuple (Pl,Pr) of the LinearSolve.jl-compatible preconditioners. To specify one-sided preconditioning, simply return nothing for the preconditioner which is not used. Additionally, precs must supply the dispatch:\nPl, Pr = precs(W, du, u, p, t, ::Nothing, ::Nothing, ::Nothing, solverdata)\nwhich is used in the solver setup phase to construct the integrator type with the preconditioners (Pl,Pr).

They can have special properties, like be symplectic integrators, and can achieve higher order for the same number of stage in comparison to diagonal methods. However, the fully implicit methods have a larger implicit system to solve and thus have a higher linear algebra cost. This can be useful in some contexts to promote more parallelism, but also since the size of the factorization is cubic and the dominant cost for large equations, multiplying O(n^3) operations to O((sn)^3) can be a considerable cost increase for FIRK tableaus, where s, the number of stages, is particularly large.

Like Gaussian collocation, it achieves higher order convergence than its stages, namely order 2s+1 for s stages. Thus RadauIIA FIRK methods tend to be some of the highest order methods (excluding extrapolation methods). This means that high order RadauIIA methods are recommended in the same scenarios that high-order explicit Runge-Kutta methods are recommended simply with the restriction of being a stiff equation. Such scenarios include cases like very low tolerances: RadauIIA methods can be the best performing methods for scenarios where tolerances are 1e-9 and below. Additionally, for ODE systems of size less than 200, the increased size of the Jacobian is mitigated by improved multithreading, since BLAS implementations are only good at multithreading LU factorizations after a certain matrix size. For this reason, RadauIIA methods tend to be recommended in cases where ODE size is small to intermediate and very accurate solutions are required.","category":"page"},{"location":"implicit/FIRK/","page":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","title":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","text":"They should be tested against the parallel implicit extrapolation which also specialize in this regime.","category":"page"},{"location":"implicit/FIRK/","page":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","title":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","text":"first_steps = evalfile(\"./common_first_steps.jl\")\nfirst_steps(\"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK\", \"RadauIIA5\")","category":"page"},{"location":"implicit/FIRK/#Full-list-of-solvers","page":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","title":"Full list of solvers","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"implicit/FIRK/","page":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","title":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","text":"RadauIIA3\nRadauIIA5\nRadauIIA9","category":"page"},{"location":"implicit/FIRK/#OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK.RadauIIA3","page":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK","title":"OrdinaryDiffEqFIRK.RadauIIA3","text":"RadauIIA3(; chunk_size = Val{0}(),\n            autodiff = true,\n            standardtag = Val{true}(),\n            concrete_jac = nothing,\n            diff_type = Val{:forward},\n            linsolve = nothing,\n            precs = DEFAULT_PRECS,\n            extrapolant = :dense,\n            smooth_est = true,\n            step_limiter! = trivial_limiter!)\n\nFully-Implicit Runge-Kutta Method.

Because of discretization error, when it is solving a Hamiltonian system it doesn't get exactly the correct trajectory on the manifold. Instead, that trajectory itself is perturbed O(Δtn) for the order n from the true trajectory. Then there's a linear drift due to numerical error of this trajectory over time Normal integrators tend to have a quadratic (or more) drift, and do not have any good global guarantees about this phase space path (just local).

Specified as either   I - gamma J or Igamma - J depending on the algorithm. This will   commonly be a WOperator type defined by OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. It is a lazy   representation of the operator. Users can construct the W-matrix on demand   by calling convert(AbstractMatrix,W) to receive an AbstractMatrix matching   the jac_prototype.\ndu: the current ODE derivative\nu: the current ODE state\np: the ODE parameters\nt: the current ODE time\nnewW: a Bool which specifies whether the W matrix has been updated since   the last call to precs.

Solver-dependent and subject to change.\nThe return is a tuple (Pl,Pr) of the LinearSolve.jl-compatible preconditioners. To specify one-sided preconditioning, simply return nothing for the preconditioner which is not used.
